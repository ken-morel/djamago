# Djamago

Have you ever used `chatbot AI <https://pypi.org/project/chatbotAI/>`_
It is a python module for creating chatting robots.

I used chatbotai since it was extremely difficult to use ai powerred modules
like  `chatterbot <https://pypi.org/project/chatterbot/>`_ which could not
install on my pc, or trying to generate them myself using torch or tensorflow.

Djamago provides a simple, bulky but personalized approach to that
by adding support for some parsing like tools.

Djamago deeply uses `djamago <https://pypi.org/project/djamago>`_
and so will you see in the examples
