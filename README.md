# Djamago

Djamago will help you to create chatbots **not using AI** as does some other projects like chatterbot.
It simply matches input to a set regular expressions to determine which function or callback to call.

What makes Djamago different are:

- It's score based approach permitting you to match each callback to several formulations of the
  same sentences or expressions
- Expressions permitting you to reuse regular expressions and save brain cells.
- Nodes, helping you keep track of questions and answers past.

# installation

You can install it from Pypi:

```bash
pip install --upgrade djamago

To be sure to have the latest version

Or you can *risk* yourself with the github version

pip install .
```
